            I hold a Bachelor of Technology (Computer Science And Engineering)
            degree from A.P.J Abdul Kalam Technical University, Ghaziabad, where
            I graduated in 2021 with a CGPA of 8.68. During my education, I
            gained a strong foundation in computer science principles and
            practical skills, which have been instrumental in my journey as a
            full-stack developer. The rigorous curriculum and hands-on projects
            provided me with a comprehensive understanding of both front-end and
            back-end development, preparing me to tackle real-world challenges
            with confidence and creativity.
